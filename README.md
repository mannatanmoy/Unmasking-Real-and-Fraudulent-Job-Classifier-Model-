# Unmasking-Real-and-Fraudulent-Job-Classifier-Model
With the increasing reliance on online job platforms, job seekers frequently encounter fraudulent job postings that compromise their time, personal information, and financial security. This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify job postings as genuine or fraudulent, helping create a safer job market.
# **Objective**
• Identify a classifier to distinguish between fake and genuine job postings. 
• Can we find which categories are highly targeted by fraudulent jobs? 
•  Try to find final result assessed using two distinct models based on text and numeric 
features. 
• Can we train One model on text data, while the other focuses on numeric data? 
• Try to combine two models to produce the final output. 
# **Machine Learning Models Used**
To identify the most effective approach, this project compares five classification models:
✔ Logistic Regression
✔ Random Forest
✔ Multinomial Naïve Bayes
✔ SGD Classifier
✔ XGBoost
# **Conclusion**
Addressing fraudulent job postings is a critical challenge that requires proactive solutions. This project tackles the issue by preprocessing textual data, selecting relevant numerical features, and combining multiple models to enhance accuracy while mitigating bias.

Key findings include hotspot locations for fraudulent jobs, such as Bakersfield, California (12:1 fake-to-real job ratio), and a higher targeting of entry-level positions. Scammers often focus on young job seekers with a bachelor’s degree or high school diploma. The most challenging aspect was preprocessing complex text data, which required extensive cleaning and organization.

This project provides valuable insights into job market fraud and contributes to a safer job-seeking environment.
